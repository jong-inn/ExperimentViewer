No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel.

This occurs when a person repeatedly experiences sexual pleasure in conjunction with a specific stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus that can elicit sexual arousal on its own.\n\nFor example, if a person associates high heels with sexual pleasure because they were exposed to it during", "5": " Sexual fetishisms are developed in early childhood. The brain is developing very quickly during childhood and is very sensitive to environmental influences. Children learn to associate certain objects, situations, or people with sexual pleasure. This can lead to sexual fetishes that persist into adulthood.", "6": "Sexual fetishisms can start due to a variety of factors. It is important to note that the topic is still widely researched and there isn't a definitive answer to this question. There are a few theories that psychologists and sexologists propose:\n1. Classical Conditioning: This theory suggests that the fetish develops through association. For example, if an object or situation was present during a person's first sexual experience or during an intense sexual experience, they may associate that object or situation with sexual arousal.\n\n2. Imprinting: Some theorists suggest that fetishism could develop through early childhood experiences, where a certain object or situation has made a deep impression.\n\n", "7": "Sexual fetishisms can start in a variety of ways, including:\nGenetic predisposition: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing fetishes, which can make them more likely to develop certain types of fetishes.\n\nEnvironmental factors: The environment can play a significant role in shaping a person's sexual preferences and fetishes. For example, growing up in a family with a strong emphasis on traditional gender roles or being exposed to sexually explicit material can increase a person's likelihood of developing a fetish.\n\nPersonal experiences: Personal experiences, such as sexual trauma or past relationships, can also contribute to", "8": "\nFetishes can start for a variety of reasons. In some cases, it may be due to an early sexual experience or exposure to a certain type of sexual stimuli. In other cases, it may be due to a combination of factors, such as genetics, environment, and psychology.

Some people may be born with a natural inclination towards certain fetishes, while others may develop them as a result of exposure to certain stimuli. For example, some people may develop a fetish for feet as a result of being forced to wear shoes for long periods of time, while others may develop a fetish for bondage as a result of reading erotic novels or watching pornography. Additionally, some people may develop fetishes as a result of traumatic experiences, such as being sexually abused as a child.\n", "10": " Sexual fetishisms can develop in many different ways. One common way for fetishism to begin is via association through repetitive exposure and imaginings. For example, a person might become aroused by an item or experience in the past, such as a certain texture or item of clothing. This could lead to the development of a fetish for that specific item or feeling. Generally, exposure to a certain stimulus repeatedly in a situation that is sexually arousing can eventually lead to the development of a fetish. Additionally, some people may have naturally occurring fetishes, often because of genetic and/or neurological factors.", "11": "Sexual fetishisms typically start when a person is exposed to a sexual idea or image at an early age.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-", "rankings": {"baize": 3, "falcon": 3, "wizard_lm": 2, "instructgpt": 2, "alpaca": 2, "vicuna": 0, "koala": 0, "chatgpt": 0, "gpt4": 0, "cohere": 0, "dolly": 0, "open_assistant": 0, "red_pajama": 0, "mpt": 0, "llama": 0}, "1": " There are several reasons why some people are more easily motivated to workout than others.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-", "rankings": {"koala": 11, "wizard_lm": 11, "vicuna": 9, "baize": 9, "chatgpt": 9, "gpt4": 9, "cohere": 9, "falcon": 8, "open_assistant": 7, "instructgpt": 5, "alpaca": 5, "llama": 5, "dolly": 3, "mpt": 3, "red_pajama": 2}, "1": " A person's level of intrinsic motivation is the primary factor in their ability to self-motivate and sustain efforts towards a goal.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel.

In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-", "rankings": {"baize": 12, "wizard_lm": 12, "chatgpt": 11, "open_assistant": 9, "alpaca": 9, "falcon": 9, "koala": 7, "cohere": 7, "dolly": 6, "red_pajama": 6, "vicuna": 5, "gpt4": 5, "instructgpt": 4, "mpt": 3, "llama": 0}, "1": " There are several reasons why some people are more easily motivated to workout than others.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-", "rankings": {"vicuna": 0, "baize": 0, "koala": 0, "wizard_lm": 0, "chatgpt": 0, "instructgpt": 0, "gpt4": 0, "cohere": 0, "dolly": 0, "open_assistant": 0, "red_pajama": 0, "mpt": 0, "alpaca": 0, "falcon": 0, "llama": 0}, "1": " There are several reasons why some people are more easily motivated to work out and can self-motivate, while others struggle with it.\n\n1.

If I'm  not mistaken, both Dresser Wayne and Gilbarco (two of the big manufacturers) make them, and have made them for a while. They have several notable drawbacks.\n\nAutomatic Cash Acceptors, ACAs, are both unreliable and inaccurate. Everyone has dealt with them in things like soda machines. They take bills without giving credit, give back incorrect change, and jam up regularly. All of these issues add overhead costs for the gas station and royally piss off customers.\n\nACA's require frequent cash refills and empties. ATM's are refilled by armed guards, which are very expensive and are usually billed by the minute for their time, armored truck time, and driver time. A gas station full of ACAs would require daily service from a security company, which again adds overhead costs for the gas station.\n\nACA's are big targets for theft. A lone ATM is already a pretty high risk, and has many security features built in to deter theft. If you put 8-10 ACA's in a single gas station lot, you run a much higher risk of theft.\n\nACA's by their very nature lose the gas station money. Gas stations make almost all their profits from customers coming into the store and buying drinks and whatnot.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-", "rankings": {"instructgpt": 3, "wizard_lm": 2, "chatgpt": 2, "dolly": 2, "vicuna": 1, "baize": 1, "koala": 1, "gpt4": 1, "cohere": 1, "open_assistant": 1, "red_pajama": 1, "falcon": 1, "mpt": 0, "alpaca": 0, "llama": 0}, "1": " People's motivations for working out will vary from person to person.

A gas station full of ACAs would require daily service from a security company, which again adds overhead costs for the gas station.\n\nACA's are big targets for theft. A lone ATM is already a pretty high risk, and has many security features built in to deter theft. If you put 8-10 ACA's in a single gas station lot, you run a much higher risk of theft.\n\nACA's by their very nature lose the gas station money. Gas stations make almost all their profits from customers coming into the store and buying drinks and whatnot.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel.

If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-", "rankings": {"dolly": 8, "chatgpt": 7, "cohere": 7, "koala": 6, "open_assistant": 6, "vicuna": 5, "instructgpt": 5, "mpt": 5, "falcon": 5, "wizard_lm": 4, "gpt4": 4, "red_pajama": 4, "baize": 3, "alpaca": 3, "llama": 0}, "1": "There are several factors that play a role in someone being motivated to workout:\n1.

No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children.

Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself.
